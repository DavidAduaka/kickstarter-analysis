# Kickstarting with Excel by David Aduaka 
## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who is looking to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, Fever. She has a budget of over $10,000 and is seeking advice about how to successfully set up and execute her campaign. She came close to reaching her fundraising goal, and is now seeking advice about how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch date and fundraising goals.

To do this, I analyzed data from various Kickstarter campaigns to determine if there are any trends in start times, fundraising goals, or other factors that can be implemented in Louise’s project.
